# Predicting customer churn
This project focuses on customer churn prediction using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churn, allowing companies to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Project overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for companies that rely on subscription models. This project uses a dataset with various characteristics related to customer behaviour and demographics to predict whether a customer will churn.

## The dataset is
Training data: There are 230 features in total, of which the first 190 are numeric and the rest are categorical.
Test data: Used to validate the model and get the final predictions.

## Results
The model predictions are saved in a file "submission.csv", which contains the predicted churn status for each customer in the test set.
